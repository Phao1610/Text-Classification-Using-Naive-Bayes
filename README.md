# Text-Classification-Using-Naive-Bayes
- Naive Bayes classifiers are a collection of classification algorithms based on Bayes’ Theorem. It is not a single algorithm but a family of algorithms where all of them share a common principle, i.e. every pair of features being classified is independent of each other.

- The dataset is divided into two parts, namely, feature matrix and the response/target vector.

- The Feature matrix (X) contains all the vectors(rows) of the dataset in which each vector consists of the value of dependent features. The number of features is d i.e. X = (x1,x2,x2, xd).

- The Response/target vector (y) contains the value of class/group variable for each row of feature matrix.

- Naive Bayes assumes that each feature/variable of the same class makes an:

      independent
      equal
      
- contribution to the outcome.

- Side Note: The assumptions made by Naive Bayes are not generally correct in real-world situations. In-fact, the independence assumption is often not met and this is why it is called “Naive” i.e. because it assumes something that might not be true.
